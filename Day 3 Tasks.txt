Q1. Modeles of SDLC:

    * Waterfall model
    *Iterative model
    *Spiral model
    *V-model
    *Big-Bang model

Q2. STLC:

    Software Testing Life Cycle (STLC) is a process used to test software and ensure that quality standards are met. Tests are carried out systematically over several phases. During product development, phases of the STLC may be performed multiple times until a product is deemed suitable for release

    1. Requirement Analysis:
        Requirement Analysis is the first step of the Software Testing Life Cycle (STLC). In this phase quality assurance team understands the requirements like what is to be tested. If anything is missing or not understandable then the quality assurance team meets with the stakeholders to better understand the detailed knowledge of requirements.  

    2. Test Planning:
        Test Planning is the most efficient phase of the software testing life cycle where all testing plans are defined. In this phase manager of the testing, team calculates the estimated effort and cost for the testing work. This phase gets started once the requirement-gathering phase is completed.

    3. Test Case Development: 
        The test case development phase gets started once the test planning phase is completed. In this phase testing team notes down the detailed test cases. The testing team also prepares the required test data for the testing. When the test cases are prepared then they are reviewed by the quality assurance team.

    4. Test Environment Setup: 
        Test environment setup is a vital part of the STLC. Basically, the test environment decides the conditions on which software is tested. This is independent activity and can be started along with test case development. In this process, the testing team is not involved. either the developer or the customer creates the testing environment.

    5. Test Execution: 
        After the test case development and test environment setup test execution phase gets started. In this phase testing team starts executing test cases based on prepared test cases in the earlier step.

    6. Test Closure: 
        Test closure is the final stage of the Software Testing Life Cycle (STLC) where all testing-related activities are completed and documented. The main objective of the test closure stage is to ensure that all testing-related activities have been completed and that the software is ready for release.

Q3. Risks and their explanations:

    *Schedule Risk
    *Budjet risk
    *Operational risk
    *Technical risk
    *Programmatic risk

    1.Schedule Risk:
        The delivery date for the project gets slipped when the risks and tasks are not scheduled properly. These risks may affect the project and can lead to project failure and impact on company economy. 

    2.Budget Risk:
        *The budget has not been estimated properly.
        *The project has expanded unexpectedly.
        *Costs have overrun.

    3.Operational Risks:
        These risks occur due to failed system, external risks due to events and lack of process implementation.

        Causes of Operational risks:

        *Priority conflicts are not resolved properly.
        *Responsibilities have not been resolved properly.
        *Lack of resources.
        *Lack of training.
        *Lack of planning and scheduling for the resources.
        *Lack of communication in the team.

    4.Technical risks:
        Technical risks occur due to lack of performance and implementation of functionalities.

        Causes of technical risks are:

        *The project requirements are changing continuously.
        *Technology advancement is not available.
        *Project implementation is complex.
        *Integration of modules has become difficult.

    5.Programmatic Risks:
        These risks are beyond the operational aspect. The events that lead to such defects are:

        *Lack of funds.
        *No market development
        *Product strategy is changed
        *Change of government rule

Q4. QA vs QC:

    QA is process-oriented, and it focuses on preventing quality issues. QC is product-oriented and focused on identifying quality issues in manufactured products that could affect customer satisfaction. Another way to understand this distinction is actions vs. results.

    QA:
        Quality Assurance is known as QA and focuses on preventing defect. Quality Assurance ensures that the approaches, techniques, methods and processes are designed for the projects are implemented correctly.

        Quality assurance activities monitor and verify that the processes used to manage and create the deliverables have been followed and are operative.

        Quality Assurance is a proactive process and is Prevention in nature. It recognizes flaws in the process. Quality Assurance has to complete before Quality Control

    QC:
        Quality Control is known as QC and focuses on identifying a defect. QC ensures that the approaches, techniques, methods and processes are designed in the project are following correctly. QC activities monitor and verify that the project deliverables meet the defined quality standards.

        Quality Control is a reactive process and is detection in nature. It recognizes the defects. Quality Control has to complete after Quality Assurance.

Q5. Manuel vs Automation:

    Manuel Testing:
        => Manual testing is the process in which QA analysts execute tests one-by-one in an individual manner. The purpose of manual testing is to catch bugs and feature issues before a software application goes live.
        => When manually testing, the tester validates the key features of a software application. Analysts execute test cases and develop summary error reports without specialized automation tools. 

    Automation Testing:
        => Automated testing is the process in which testers utilize tools and scripts to automate testing efforts.
        => Automated testing helps testers execute more test cases and improve test coverage. When comparing manual vs. automation testing, manual takes longer. Automated testing is more efficient.
